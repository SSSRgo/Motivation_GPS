% This program has been optimized for running on multicore CPU's. Different
% parts of the program will make use of parallel execution of calculations. 
% In this parameter you can set the number of cpu cores you have available.
% Setting it to 'max' will make Matlab use the maximum possible for your 
% computer. 
%       Example:    p.numCpuCores = 'max';
%
% If you don't want it to use the maximum you can set it to a lower value
% by typing the number of cpu cores you want it to run on.
%       Example:    p.numCpuCores = 2;
%
% On a local computer the maximum number of cores you can set is 12 even if 
% your computer has more cores, this is because of limitations in the 
% Matlab parallel computing toolbox. (12 on Matlab 2011b and later, 8 on
